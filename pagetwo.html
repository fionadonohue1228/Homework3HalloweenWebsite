   So what exactly is the point of this website? Well this is a Halloween trend website. Now, let us compare the most famous Halloween costumes from 2025 to 1990. Now for 1990, one of
    the most popular Halloween costume was a ghost. It was cheap and easy to do. Now the most popular Halloween costume for 2025 is Rumi from Kpop Demon Hunters. This is likely due to 
    social media influences and the popularity with the movie amongst Gen Alpha. It is very similar to the uproar with the movie Frozen amongst Gen Z. That year Elsa was one of the most
    popular Halloween costumes. Something else we notice with this trend is that although in 1990 the most popular Halloween costume is a ghost, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was one of
    the most popular shows and considered to be one of the most popular Halloween costumes at that time. We notice that there seems to be a correlation between popular children's shows
    and movies and Halloween costumes. For the year 2026, we will keep track of the most popular movies from January to September and predict what the top 10 Halloween costumes will 
    be for Halloween 2026. This will raise the question of will it differ much from the year 2025 or stay pretty much the same.
