  Welcome to this Spooky Halloween Website ðŸ‘»

Hi, my name is Fiona Donohue. I am currently a 3rd year here at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Economics. I am from Northern New Jersey and one of my fun facts is that
I have two cats and two dogs. Another fun fact is that I can do 20 cartwheels in a row. One of my favorite holidays is coming up soon... Halloween! This year I am going to be a zombie.
Personally, I believe that this is a classic Halloween costume,  as it gets the spooky vibes that I am going for. On Halloween, I always make sure to go all out. In the past I have 
been a vampire, cat, devil, peanut butter sandwich and Velma from Scooby Doo. Now since I have an obsession with Halloween, I know some festive fun facts. A pumpkin is considered a 
fruit and not a vegetable. Trick-or-Treating was actually paused during World War 2 due to the sugar shortage. However, this year for Halloween people are going all out. As it is 
estimated that 73 percent of Americans will celebrate Halloween this year with consumer spending estimated at 13.1 billion dollars. This website is used to compare Halloween trends over 
the years.
