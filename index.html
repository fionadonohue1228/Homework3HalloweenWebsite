  Welcome to this Spooky Halloween Website ðŸ‘»

Hi, my name is Fiona Donohue. I am currently a 3rd year here at Northeastern Univeristy studying Data Science and Economics. One of my favorite holidays is coming up soon... Halloween!
This year I am going to be a cat and my friend is going to be a cowboy. One of my other friend's 21st birthday is on Halloween. We are going to celebrate by going to a party at her home.
I am thrilled to celebrate Halloween and my friends 21st birthday so I am creating this website for her. Now even though I love Halloween, no one loves it as much as my friend.
